We all know that access to healthcare in Nigeria can be challenging and thorough. It is absurd that the first thing to living is being healthy. Carefinder is a simple tool that aims to help users find, export, and share hospitals within the region.

**Carefinder Features

– Hospital Search: Carefinder allows users to search for hospitals within their region. Users can input their location or select from a list of nearby cities to find hospitals in their area. The platform will list hospitals and their respective contact details, including address, phone number, and email.

– Export Hospitals: Carefinder allows users to export the list of hospitals to a CSV file, making it easy to save and share the information. This feature will be implemented using Firebase’s built-in file storage.

– Share Hospitals: Carefinder also allows users to share the list of hospitals with others. Users can share the information via email or by generating a shareable link. This feature will be implemented using Firebase’s built-in email and link-sharing functionalities.

– User Authentication: Carefinder requires admin users to create an account to access the platform’s admin features. This feature will be implemented using Firebase’s built-in authentication feature, which supports multiple authentication methods, including email/password and social media logins.

– Markdown Support: Carefinder allows admin users to write content(create hospital entries and corresponding details) with a markdown. This feature makes it easy for users to format their content, add links, and insert images. The platform will provide a simple text editor that supports markdown syntax.
